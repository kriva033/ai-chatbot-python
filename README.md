# ai-chatbot-python
AI Chatbot with OpenAI LLM and GPT-3.5 Turbo Model

------------------------------------------------------ Instructions ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This project needs a valid API key from OpenAI, it can be generated from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

1: Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2: Download PyCharm (Or use your own IDE) from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
3: Required Python Libraries (as used in this chatbot project) are: Streamlit, PyPDF2, Langchain and FAISS. Install these packages by running: pip install streamlit pypdf2 langchain faiss-cpu (I did this on MacOS)
4: Use any .pdf document. Note: If the uploaded file is large, the token consumption for each interaction will also be significantly higher, leading to substantial costs.
5. Finally, update the code "chatbot.py" to add your own API KEY to "OPENAI_API_KEY"
